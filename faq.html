    <h1>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

    <h2>üß† General Questions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Do I need to submit a new form to change my data?</summary>
      <p>You can submit a new form and select "I'm already listed, but need to update my information."</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What is the Free Snake Relocation Directory?</summary>
      <p>A volunteer-based network that connects individuals with local volunteers who relocate snakes free of charge. All volunteers act independently and at their own risk.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I find a snake volunteer near me?</summary>
      <p>Use our interactive map or the "Find Closest Volunteer" tool to locate a nearby independent volunteer. We do not assign or dispatch individuals; all participation is voluntary.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Will I be charged?</summary>
      <p>No. All relocations through this directory are provided by volunteers at no cost. Volunteers may not always be available, and they are not authorized to charge for relocation services listed here.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What areas does the directory cover?</summary>
      <p>We have volunteers across many U.S. states. Use the interactive map to explore available volunteers near you. Coverage depends entirely on who has volunteered in each region.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Snake Safety & Identification</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What should I do if I see a snake?</summary>
      <p>Stay calm! Back away slowly and contact a volunteer through the directory. Do not attempt to handle the snake yourself unless you are properly trained and permitted to do so.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Are all snakes dangerous?</summary>
      <p>Not at all. Most snakes are non-venomous and play a critical role in pest control and healthy ecosystems. Even venomous snakes rarely pose a threat unless provoked or handled.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I kill a snake if I feel threatened?</summary>
      <p>Many states protect native snakes by law. Killing them is often unnecessary‚Äîand sometimes illegal. Please contact a volunteer instead to help relocate the animal safely and legally.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What is a safe distance to relocate a snake?</summary>
      <p>Research shows that relocated snakes often have a lower survival rate compared to those left in their home range. Many snakes try to return to where they were caught, which puts them at risk from predators, roads, and exhaustion.</p>
      <p>Most studies define a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù relocation as <strong>less than 1 kilometer (about 0.6 miles)</strong> from where the snake was found. This keeps the snake within its familiar home range, helping it find shelter, food, and safe travel routes. Moves beyond 2‚Äì3 km often lead to lower survival rates because the snake is in completely unfamiliar territory.</p>
