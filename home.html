    <h1>Welcome to Free Snake Relocation!</h1>

    <p>Free Snake Relocation is a volunteer-driven initiative dedicated to the humane removal and relocation of snakes from homes, businesses, and other human-occupied spaces. Our mission is simple: to protect both people and snakes by offering a free, safe, and educational service. Founded by those with a passion for wildlife conservation, the project has grown into a national network of volunteers who believe that coexistence with nature is not only possible—but essential.</p>

    <p>Snakes are an important part of the ecosystem. Unfortunately, they’re often misunderstood and needlessly killed out of fear. Our team works to change that narrative by providing:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Free snake removal and relocation services where volunteers are available</li>
      <li>Education about native snakes and their ecological benefits</li>
      <li>Support for people who encounter snakes and aren’t sure what to do</li>
      <li>Opportunities to volunteer and make a positive impact in your local area</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of our relocators is committed to handling snakes responsibly, without causing harm. While we are not a pest control company, we are real people—mothers, fathers, students, veterans, nature lovers—who are trained in safe capture and release methods. We believe in giving people peace of mind while giving snakes a second chance in a safe, wild environment.</p>
