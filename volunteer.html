    <h2>Free Snake Relocation Directory – Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>1. General Information</strong><br>
    The Free Snake Relocation Directory is an informational resource only. This group serves as a platform where individuals in need of snake relocation services can connect with independent volunteers willing to assist. We do not vet, train, endorse, or supervise any volunteers.</p>

    <p><strong>2. No Liability for Injury or Damages</strong><br>
    By using this directory, all parties understand and agree that:
    <ul>
      <li>Volunteers act independently and are not agents, employees, or representatives of this group or its administrators.</li>
      <li>The Free Snake Relocation Directory and its administrators are not responsible for any injuries, bites, accidents, or property damage that may occur during any relocation efforts.</li>
      <li>Homeowners and volunteers engage in snake relocation at their own risk and should take appropriate precautions, including verifying qualifications and experience.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><strong>3. No Guarantees or Warranties</strong><br>
    We make no guarantees regarding the reliability, experience, or success of any volunteer. It is the responsibility of homeowners and volunteers to communicate, assess risks, and determine if relocation is appropriate.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Compliance with Local Laws</strong><br>
    Volunteers and homeowners are solely responsible for ensuring their activities comply with local, state, and federal wildlife laws. Some jurisdictions may require permits or special training to handle certain species.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Homeowner Permission and Property Access</strong><br>
    Volunteers must obtain explicit permission from the homeowner before entering private property or removing a snake. Volunteers should clarify the homeowner’s expectations regarding how the snake will be relocated and where it will be released. If property damage occurs, it is the responsibility of the volunteer and homeowner to resolve the issue directly. The Free Snake Relocation Directory and its administrators are not responsible for any disputes or damages.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Agreement to Terms</strong><br>
