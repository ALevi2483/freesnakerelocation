    <h2>In Memory of Jason Landers</h2>
    <p>Today, and always, we honor <strong>Jason Landers</strong>—the heart and soul behind the Free Snake Relocation Directory. He left us far too soon, but his impact on this world and the lives he touched will never fade.</p>
    
    <p>Jason was more than just the creator of this group—he was a passionate advocate for all wildlife, especially reptiles. His dedication to conservation and education built a community that continues to save countless snakes and educate the public.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond his love for reptiles, Jason was also the owner and operator of <em>Aquariums For Life</em>, where he designed and maintained stunning aquatic habitats. His love for nature was boundless, extending to all creatures, great and small.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Jason</strong>, your knowledge, generosity, and adventurous spirit will forever be a part of this community. You are deeply missed, but your legacy lives on in every snake that is safely relocated and every person who learns to respect wildlife.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Rest in peace, Jason. We’ve got this. 🐍💚</strong></p>
